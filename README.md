# Notes
Current beta build (beta 2) as of writing this currently has a broken application that runs after post installation. It shouldn't damage the system in any way, so I'm not too worried about it. Will patch in beta 3.
We are not affiliated with Microsoft in any way.
Also, Microsoft Edge has been completely removed from the .ISO
